## 🚀 Active Projects

### 1. explainable-loan-approval-default-model
**Problem:** Balancing loan approval volume with the necessity of default prevention.
**Solution:** A dual-gate machine learning system. Stage 1 replicates historical approval policies, while Stage 2 uses an XGBoost risk engine to predict the Probability of Default (PD) for approved applicants.
**Key Results:** * **Default Capture:** Successfully identified ~69% of historical defaults.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Reduced the expected default rate among approved loans to ~11.4%.
* **Explainability:** Utilized SHAP for regulatory-compliant, feature-level transparency.
